Hi!

My name is Javier, and,
I'm a **looker focused on details**, that is why most of the time I* crave to know what is behind the things that we all see*. In fact, that is the reason that lead me to this IT area, the will to know what data can say about things.

Besides that, personally, I find myself as a passionate about of music and photography.
